<<<<<<< Updated upstream
This module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. 
Each has been recast  a form suitable for Python.
The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. 
Together, they form an “iterator algebra” make it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.
